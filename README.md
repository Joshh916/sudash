SUDash, Servarr Unified Dashboard, is a download dashboard which connects to sonarr, radarr, and transmission to more easily manage downloading new videos.

sudash.conf needs to be configured before it can function properly, create a random string of numbers and letters, no spaces, for the secret key, the longer the better. 

A sqlite db named sudash.db is needed to store data user data.

requirements.txt contains all of the necessary modules needed to run SUDash
